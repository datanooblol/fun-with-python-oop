# README.md Structure for Lessons

## Required Sections (in order)
Each lesson's README.md must follow this exact structure:

### 1. Title
```markdown
# Lesson [Number]: [Topic Name]
```

### 2. 📚 Concept
- Brief explanation of the concept (2-4 sentences)
- What problem does it solve?
- Keep it beginner-friendly

### 3. 🎯 Key Points
- Use bullet points (3-5 points)
- Highlight the most important takeaways
- Focus on practical understanding

### 4. 💡 When to Use
- Real-world scenarios where this concept applies
- 2-3 concrete examples
- Help learners understand practical applications

### 5. 🔍 Example Overview
- Brief description of what example.py demonstrates
- List the examples included (Example 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Keep it concise

### 6. 🎬 What Happens Behind the Scenes? (Optional but Recommended)
- Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize internal processes
- Explain what Python does internally, not just how to write code
- Include sequence diagrams for process flow
- Include graph/flowchart diagrams for memory/structure visualization
- Add step-by-step breakdown after diagrams
- Focus on understanding, not just syntax

### 7. 🚀 Run the Example
```markdown
## 🚀 Run the Example
\`\`\`bash
python lessons/[lesson_folder]/example.py
\`\`\`
```

### 8. 📖 Further Reading (Optional)
- Links to official Python docs
- Relevant PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)
- External libraries that use this concept (mention only, don't require installation)

## Style Guidelines
- Use emojis for section headers (📚 🎯 💡 🔍 🎬 🚀 📖)
- Keep language simple and conversational
- Avoid jargon without explanation
- Use code snippets sparingly in README (main code is in example.py)
- Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize internal processes and concepts
- Maximum length: ~200-300 lines
